What I want to understand better is how the user stories should be constructed in the most effective way and actually be vertical. 
This was something we noticed we had not done so far. Every user story should be integrating backend and front end
In last sprint planning, we had this in mind and tried to make them vertical. However, since this was not done in previous sprints, we had to make a user story which integrated all parts from previous sprints.

By discussing in the team about how sprint planning and sprint review should be done differently than last week, 
I feel like we all have contributed to make the meetings more effective and the point estimation to (hopefully) be more accurate.
I feel like the concept of scrum is becoming more clear for every week.

My contribution towards the team's deliveries has been to work on the assigned tasks continously during the week.
All pairs have been communicating very well and been able to help each other out whenever faced a problem, including me.
Several times this week, all pairs have worked at the same time but separately (every pair in their own voice channel at discord).
