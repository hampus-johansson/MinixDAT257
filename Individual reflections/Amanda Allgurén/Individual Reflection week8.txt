Due to stress caused by the bachelor thesis (and holiday), we have postponed our sprint planning session to Monday morning and therefore I do not know yet what I will be working on in this sprint.
The sprint will be much about bug fixes and maybe one new feature.

My contribution towards the use of scrum has been by actively participate in sprint review, sprint planning and writing the team reflection.
I make sure that all my questions regarding scrum is asked and discussed during the team meetings.

My contribution toward the team's deliveries this week has been to set up scheduled jobs for the database to be updated continuously. 
Also, I have been able to use my knowledge about Lime Go to continue working on an user story in the back log. 
My programming pair for this week have all been working on different parts of the project before, 
and it was really helpful to join together and know all the code to 100% when joining it when setting up the scheduled jobs. 
This made all problems faced much faster fixed.
