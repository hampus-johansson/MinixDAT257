I want to understand the concept Scrum better, by actively working with the process. I believe this will be easier when we start the development and start decomposing the workload into sprints and reviewing the sprints. 
This week, I have gotten a better understanding of sprint planning and sprint reviews, as well as why it is important. 
Also, the structuring of different user stories and how to extract tasks from these are much clearer now and I think this will help us (the team) to structure our own project better.

My contribution to the team this week has been to participate in all lectures to be able to join discussions within the team. 
By actively joining the meeting with our project owner at CTK, I was able to contribute with questions regarding the product asked for, for the team to get a better understanding about what is to be delivered.
