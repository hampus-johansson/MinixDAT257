Since we completed out MVP last sprint, this sprint has only been focused on bug fixing, presentation and final report.

My contribution towards the use of scrum has been by actively participate in sprint review, sprint planning and writing the team reflection.
I have and will continue to focus on the final report writing rather than the presentation prep.

My contribution toward the team's deliveries this week has been to add a small feature for the Lime Go fetching and corrected a bug.
