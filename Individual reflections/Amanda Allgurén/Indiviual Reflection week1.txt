The learning objective I have chosen for this course is to understand and be able to use Scrum in the development of a new product. This is a concept I have only heard of briefly but have not understood how or why it is used. 

Since I am not very familiar with the term Scrum, I am today unsure how I can contribute to the team within this area. What I know is that I am very eager to learn and work together with the team to get a better understanding about the task itself and the process we are using while developing using scrum. 

I contributed with options and suggestions writing the social contract this week. Further on, I think I can contribute with my programming skills and by making sure that we have great documentation from each sprint, making it easier to track. I have started to look at creating a digital version of a wall-based scrum board we might use for each sprint but have not yet discussed it with the team.

By attending all the lectures, having discussions within the team and do readings of what I feel like having lacking knowledge in, I think I can reach my learning objective.
