What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have learnt a lot about the scrum process and about SQL and Power BI. Related to our specific project, there isn't really much more to learn. However, I think I would have gotten an even better insight into the scrum process if we had done a larger project. It would e.g. be interesting to have daily scrum meetings. 
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As always, by taking part in discussions and collaborating on the tasks. 
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have attended all meetings and actively planned/reviewed the process with the rest of the group.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Besides planning and reviewing, I also finished the tasks I was assigned. I have also, together with another group member, taken extra responsibility for planning the demo and presentation.
