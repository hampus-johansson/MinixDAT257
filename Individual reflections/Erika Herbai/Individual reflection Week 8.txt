What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to acquire a bit more knowledge about what the other programming groups have done in order to fully understand how our final software will work.
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As always, by showing everyone what my group has done, as well as being active during our discussions.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have attended all meetings, added my time into clockify and I have actively taken part in the sprint review and sprint planning, much like all other weeks.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have, together with one other person in my group, managed to collect data from an online excel file in order to fulfill the stakeholder’s need to see how many quotes each employee has sent in. We have been working more vertically lately and had another demo to show the client. As always, I have taken part in discussions/reflections/planning/reviewing.
