What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand Github better since I haven’t worked with it before, as well as Power BI since it is highly relevant for our project. 
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Actively take part in meetings and discussions and do my part of the tasks.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We planned our first sprint this week and we all contributed through “planning poker” and discussions about how large the tasks are etc. 
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We created user stories as well as planned our first real sprint. All contributions have so far been made together in a group.
