What do I want to learn or understand better?
I need to learn about collecting data from another program into Power BI in order to be able to perform this week’s user story that I’m assigned to.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As always, by actively taking part in meetings and discussions and doing my part of the tasks. Also by stepping in if another programming group has fallen behind because of a more difficult task.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively taking part in meetings and trying to take initiatives during our discussions. I feel like the scrum process has become more of a routine for everyone in the group now which is great. Because of this, both planning and reviewing of the sprint went faster this week since we were more efficient. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have, together with two other members of my group, created a setup file in T-SQL with tables that are supposed to be used in Power BI to store data from clockify and limego. We also connected Power BI to a database on my computer and created an “if statement” for the different salary levels, as well as tested the program with some “made up” inserts. I think we worked very well and we finished our user story during the sprint.
