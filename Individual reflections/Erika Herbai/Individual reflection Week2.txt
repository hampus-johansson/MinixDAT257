Individual reflection - Week 2
 
What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more about the Scrum process but I do have more knowledge about it compared to week 1. Since we haven’t started actually developing the software, I have not yet had time to learn more coding. 
 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Much like last week I think we will help each other a lot. I have this week noticed that we all have (somewhat) different backgrounds when it comes to programming and we’ve already helped each other by asking/replying to questions etc during our meetings.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We all helped out during the minetest Scrum challenge but since I had never played minecraft before I had a bit of an entry barrier when it comes to understanding the game. The planning of the sprints etc went well though.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we have planned a little more and we have discussed our project scope. I took part in the discussions and we wrote the project scope document together.
